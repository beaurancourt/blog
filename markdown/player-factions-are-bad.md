I still maintain that the biggest design failure in World of Warcraft is the
two-faction system. It has lead to *so* many problems:

* Players of the larger faction have difficulty finding structured PvP against
  the smaller faction.
* Players of the smaller faction have difficulty *existing in the world* of the
  larger faction.
* Players of the smaller faction may experience [human capital
  flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_capital_flight) as the better
  players simply move to the larger faction. This makes the smaller faction
  even smaller and the larger faction even larger.
* Friends who meet each other *after* playing that are on different factions
  are unable to play *with* each other.
* Players are locked out of **huge amounts** of meticulously created content
  for the other faction.

The more systems you tie into factions, the harder the choice (and the more
decision paralysis) you put on a player. They now either has to make the
decision blindly or put up a large amount of up-front research. If the factions
tie into player power and aesthetic identity, now you force players to either
be strong but look unappealing (to them), or be weak but look appealing.  If
factions tie into who you're able to fight in PvP, then now you're forced to
ally with players who you may like less than *anyone on the other faction*.

*Much* better is to have player's main allegiance be to player-created guilds.
Cap guild sizes at relatively small numbers (say, ~100), and make everyone not
in your guild potentially hostile. Prevent griefing via the sorts of karma
systems used in albion online, and preserve the new player experience by
disabling non-consentual PvP in most zones. Check out EvE Online's
implementation of [zone
security](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/System_security) for a tried-and-true
way to achieve this.
