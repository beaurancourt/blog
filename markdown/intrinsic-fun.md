People (salaried professional aside) play games for fun. Further, people
generally enjoy different things in different ways.

I was having a conversation with a friend of mine about some ideal patch notes
for a sort of Wow 2.0 based off of World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade. I
was spitballing about removing factions from everything but questing/lore,
allowing guilds to fight over and tax cities and settlements, making mobs drop
materials/crafting patterns instead of completed items and more controversially
change a lot of the instanced dungeons and raids to be open-world. The idea is
that TBC is so solved that we could introduce generated conflict and content
allowing them to contest each other for important resources.

In my head, that sounds sweet and like the sort of game I could play for hours
every day for *years*, instead of the TBC we have where we can quickly get our
BiS and then raidlog / do arenas every week. To my friend, on the other hand,
having to engage in server politics to form alliances to secure boss spawns,
or be expected to be online to defend a city you control, or have to go protect
guildies while they try to kill a boss in Serpent Shrine Cavern sounds miserable.

They don't find that stuff fun, so it gets in the way of what they *do* thin is
fun: speedrunning raids for loot and doing rank-1 level 3v3 and 2v2 arena.

This is where the intrinsic fun comes in! Whenever a game is unfocused, you
will have players that are willing to *put up* with some of your systems in
order to be able to interact with others. A MMO player who loves PvP might be
willing to slog through leveling and PvE content so that they can have the BiS
gear to compete in capture-the-flag. A hardcore raider might be willing to slog
through a bunch of frustrating 2v2 matches if it [rewards
them](/posts/make-it-always-good) with the best PvE gear. MMOs try to cater to
all kinds of playstyles, and try to lump crafters, marketeers, PvP players,
casual explorers, hardcore raiders, etc all togtether in one game.

Now, if you attempt to emphasize hardcore raiding, you'll have PvP players and
marketeers complain that they have to go through *more* of a slog to be able to
do the thing they enjoy. You'll hear the phrase "can't please everyone". Eventually
the game devs lose sight of their target audience, or worse, they start designing
for retention metrics or profit maximization. The game is no longer the game *they*
want to play, it's created for some nebulous user that was derived by averaging
user feedback surveys.

In focused games like Rocket League, on the other hand, the community is almost
singularly behind one idea: winning car soccer in a fair, skillful match
against the other team. They're down for changes that make the matches more fair
and down for changes that remove bugs that make the game less skillful.

I would love to see the MMO genre try to actually figure out what their target
audience is and then build the best game *for those people*.
