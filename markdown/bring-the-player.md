One of the hallmarks of MMOs is players having to invest time in [character
progression](/posts/progression) in particular character differentiators. This
comes in a lot of forms and is implemented in different ways in different games,
but some key results remain the same.

* In Final Fantasy XIV, you can only level up one "Job" at a time
* In World of Warcraft, you character can only ever be one class
* In Albion Online, you can only gain experience in one weapon/head/chest/boots
  type at a time

Moreover, forming effective groups with other people means using the information about their
differentiating choice somehow. In World of Warcraft, you probably want to have
a tank, a healer, and 3 dps for a 5-man dungeon. In FFXIV, you want a tank, a
healer, and 2 dps for a 4-man dungeon.

Some MMOs try to design their game such that you can [bring the player, not the
class](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/7x3svi/bring_the_player_not_the_class_meaning/).
The extreme form of this is that a group of any 5 classes is equally effective
as any other group of 5 classes. Less extreme forms of this are what modern WoW
designs for where the classes are sorted into "roles" (like tank, healer, dps), and
then any class in those roles are exchangable.

The opposite end of this are in-game challenges that require *specific* groups.
Say, for example, that you had a dungeon that was only beatable if you had a
rogue to pick an interior lock, a hunter to soothe a deadly beast, etc. Or, say
that each class has an *extremely* strong non-stacking buff such that it's
*never* worth brining two rogues to the same 5-man party because that would
mean your 5-man group has at most 4 buffs instead of 5.

What ends up happening is that now friend-groups are forced to diversify. Some
players are effectively unable to play with others. You might never want to
bring two rogues to the same 5-man group, and so those rogues are unable to
play together. This creates player-supply/demand pressure and forces players to
decide between being *desirable* (the class with the best demand:supply ratio)
and being *what they want to play*. This adds onboarding complexity and decision
analysis paralysis to picking a class in the first place.

The downside to the bring-the-player philosophy is that now inter-class balance
is a huge concern. Now that we don't have to diversify our groups, why would we
bring anything but the best performing class? You end up with hard META
requirements and players bringing [20 warriors to a 40 man
raid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Htmzbf9TdMA).

Now to have a healthy game, you *must* try to balance as well as possible.
Players need to be assured that their class will be viable as much as possible,
since they've often invested *thousands* of hours into it.  Collect internal
metrics about which classes and builds are performing the best and worst in
actual play.  Automatically (as in with
automation) [propose changes](/posts/patch-governance) to those classes/builds
as soon as they exceed tolerance levels. Be transparent about your
methodologies. Repeat until your game is stable.
