If a boss is sufficiently difficult enough to challenging when your group
is uncontested, it will be borderline impossible when your group is contested,
even if you're contested by a single stealthed rogue.

If a boss is sufficiently easy enough to be done while your group is
contested, it will be boring when your group is uncontested.

For an example of the first type of encounter design, consider that it took
[346 wipes](https://www.method.gg/raid-history/battle-for-azeroth) before
method was able to get their [first
kill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhLQp0H0Xks) on
[jaina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m35B8WhomcQ). Would that fight be
possible at all if, during any of the critical mechanics, an enemy player can
try to stun you? The encounter design would stop working.

The second design turns the boss into something to fight over, similar to Baron
Nashor in League of Legends. The boss is dangerous, and has HP, and might
perform big telegraphed attacks or weaken whoever is currently trying to fight
it, but it's less of a hugely complicated mechanical skill check and more of a
thing-that-drives-player-conflict. When there *are* no other players, then it's
not serving its purpose and the fight itself feels empty.

I love the idea of open-world bosses, but I also don't want to lose my
lovingly-crafted encounter design that's been perfected over the years by FFXIV
and WoW. Here's a potential solution:

Keep some of the open world bosses like the above. Preserving "something to
fight over" as a type of content like Baron Nashor is important.

Then, make it so that some of your open-world bosses have the following
pattern: players fight over the ability to challenge the boss uncontested while
everyone else has to watch. If that group wipes, they respawn, and the process
repeats.

You can flavor this in any number of ways. WoW, for example, has the Gurubashi
Arena. You can make it so that whichever party successfully opens the Gurubashi
Arena Chest spawns the boss. Everyone else is booted up to the stands and they
have to watch as the boss attempt goes down. If the raid wipes, then everyone
can go duke it out again and try to open the chest for another shot. If the
group kills the boss, playtime is over.

If you're fighting a shadowy demon boss, maybe before the boss spawns, their
*Envoy* spawns, as a miniboss to squabble over like Baron Nashor. Whichever
group manages to defeat the Envoy gets a limited-time, limited area buff that
makes them all shadowy (curse of shadows). Other players can't interact with
them in any way, and only those players can interact with the boss
that's about to spawn. If they wipe to the boss, the boss goes back to the
shadows, and the Envoy respawns.

There are any number of ways to flavor it, but the goal is the same! We're just
trying to find a way to circumvent "if a boss is sufficiently difficult
enough to challenging when your group is uncontested, it will be borderline
impossible when your group is contested".

Traditional answers to the above problem are along the lines of "guard the
entrance to the area" or "use diplomacy". I think these answers either
underestimate how difficult encounters like Jaina were (346 wipes, people) and
don't think about how you can't let a *single* person through (stealthed or
otherwise). Or don't think about the ratio of guards to raiders that you would
need for the guards to adequately protect the raiders for 346 wipes.
Or how **mind-numbingly boring** that would be as a guard.

On the diplomacy front, this is something that a single stealthed rogue can
ruin. If one upset nerd has the power to wipe your group over and over, you bet
your bottom dollar they'll try over and over.
