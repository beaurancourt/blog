If you read discussions critiquing retail World of Warcraft, especially in
relation to vanilla WoW, I find that the dialog is mostly around the following
concepts:

* Group/Raid Finder
* Flying Mounts
* Class Identity/Homogenization
* No Feeling of Community
* Teleporting to Instances

I think the playerbase is quick to blame accessability, casualization, and
blizzard's bottom line for the above problems, but I think the ideas are much
more nuanced and often interlinked. In depth:

### Group/Raid Finder
Back in 2005, if you wanted to run Upper Blackrock Spire as the alliance, you
probably spammed Trade Chat, General Chat, and (maybe) LookingForGroup for with
a message like "LFM 1 tank 2 DPS UBRS" until folks joined. If you were smart you
did this in a macro. When you wanted to run a different dungeon, you edited your
macro to the other dungeon abbreviation. If you were trying to find a dungeon
group to join, you would watch trade chat for this sort of spam.

If you saw a group you wanted to join, you would click the person's name and
write "inv". Maybe they'd just invite you, sometimes they'd check your
level/class by shift+clicking your name in chat. Sometimes they'd be looking for
particular classes to avoid loot conflicts.

I often see it argued that this sort of spam advertising is valuable
communication. I think that's nonsense. I think the game would be *much* better
off by putting a UI on top of this interaction and keep the chat channels clear
of spam. As a group leader, let me list my group and see which players have
have listed themselves as wanting to do UBRS so I can shoot them
messages/invites. As a player, let me list myself so I can see which group
leaders are currently putting groups together so I can message them. Let me
inspect their class/level/gear from the interface. **Do not** make it cross
realm.

Finally, for some economic spice, add a "bid" column. It's an economic fact
that different classes will have different demand than others. Classic WoW had
a massive tank shortage, for instance. Let players put in a bid of gold to be
invited to the group. If you put in a negative gold amount, the rest of the
party pays you for the run, and if you put in a positive gold amount, you pay
the rest of the party for the run. This lets less desirable builds compensate
for their off-meta choices with bribes, and les groups attract tanks and healers
without inflating the economy.

### Flying Mounts/Teleporting To Instances
Flying for the first time was an amazing feeling, probably one of the coolest,
most exciting experiences I've had in WoW. The anticipation as I was leveling
up through the Burning Crusade after the all-nighter to hit max so I could fly
was immense. Within a few months though, the playerbase realized the faustian
bargain they had made: in exchange for the power of flight, they had given up
the feeling of danger. Previously engaging journeys through potentially
dangerous lands, either because you were on a PvP server and could be ganked,
or because you were running through elite mobs and could be dazed to death were
now trivial.

Over night, the tension evaporated. The world of WoW shrunk as the max mount
speed increased from 2x run speed on my mechanostrider to 4.1x run speed
on my gladiator flying mount. Folks didn't have to ride through valleys
or remember how to navigate mountain terrain or follow roads, you just look at
map markers and fly directly there, and were probably completely okay to
alt-tab and look at something else. You're safe, after all.

Following this, the (reasonable) question became: "Why are we travelling at all?"
If travel is riskless, uninteresting, and quick... why do it? I don't have a
good answer there. A game like Ashes of Creation wants travel to be meaningful
- there's always a chance that another player kills you on the road and takes
your materials and certificates. That further plays into the bounty/crafting
system. WoW, especially on PvE (originally labeled "Normal") servers doesn't
have any of that.

It's no surprise then, that when group-finder eventually came, the group was put
directly into the dungeon, as the journey had been rendered toothless.

### Class Identity/Homogenization
Before I can talk about class design, I have to talk about what
[difficulty](/posts/what-is-difficulty) is. The [linked
article](/posts/what-is-difficulty) goes further in depth, but the core idea is
that every video game can be broken down into two components: "the puzzle" and
"the beatmap". "The puzzle" is the part of the game where you're trying to
translate the information on your screen and in your headphones into "the
beatmap". "The beatmap" is which buttons and mouse motions you need to make
*and when*. A game like guitar hero has a trivially easy "puzzle" - they
literally give you a beatmap on screen. A game like chess has a trivially easy
beatmap - once you've solved the puzzle you just click the piece you want to
move and plop it down in the square you want to move it to.

Classic WoW started off with *incredibly* simple puzzles and beatmaps for
basically everyone but healers and fury warriors. Healers because you can always
bring less healers on a speedrun if they play better (coordinating healing,
consumable management, drink-walking, down-casting, mana management), and fury
warriors because I still haven't seen a warrior parse that manages to spend
their rage 98% efficiently across a speed clear. They eventually whirlwind when
they should have bloodthirsted, or bloodthirst when they should have waited to
execute. High skill cap puzzle.

The beatmap for most vanilla classes is absurdly boring. Imagine if we put a
guitar hero song to molten core frost mage gameplay, where frostbolt is the
green button on the fret bar. Green, green, green, green, green every 2.5
seconds.

A lot of the problems are because of mana. Consider this: when your class is
mana-based, you have a slowly dwindling, slowly regenerating resource that
gives you all of your offensive options, all of your defensive options, and all
of your utility options until you run out of mana, and then you have none of
those. This means the only real decision you make is before the fight - "how do
I play for short/medium/long fights" and "do I think this is a
short/medium/long fight".

The play pattern in a solo or group setting becomes to wait for the casters to
have full mana, go wild until they're tapped out, and then repeat.

Contrast this with the rage-based warrior (the original builder/spender). At the
beginning of a fight you don't have rage, and so your options are limited, and
you need to ramp up to damage (which is a telegraph in PvP, and is a good thing
but that's a separate topic). Once you get rage, you have decision pressure
between spending that rage on offense/defense/utility, whereas the mana user
never has that pressure until they're manaless. Additionally, within those
categories you also have the further option to wait for *more* rage to use more
rage-efficient options. For example, you might have heroic strike which only
costs 15 rage, but does far less damage per rage than bloodthrist at 30 rage.

But, if you wait for that 30 rage, you might miss your damage window, or get
stunned, or the enemy might use a defensive or move, etc. Damage now vs damage
later.

The actual play result in Vanilla is that some classes were wildly better than
others at a design level to the point where the players playing those classes
were passed up in difficult content. Druids and paladins were forced into
healing roles, even though they imagined themselves as shape shifters or holy
warriors respectively.

Blizzard shifted their design priority to a philosophy called **Bring the
Player**. The idea was that Vanilla had a number of niches - mages had arcane
intellect, priests had power word: fortitude, etc. When putting a group together,
players had an optimal group composition and if the class/spec didn't find that
group they were relectant to take you. Retribution paladins didn't find that
composition. "Bring the player" attempted to bridge the gap by making sure that
roughly any 5 man group of tank/healer/3 dps would be viable, and any 20 man
group of 2 tank/4 healer/14 dps (roughly) would be viable. Bringing 14 rogues
would still be dicey, but now you're not looking for a super specific comp.

They accomplished this by bringing the classes more in line with each other. If
previously only mages provided a crit buff, now maybe balance druids and rogues
could do it too. If only rogues could had temporary magic immunity, now so did
death knights and retribution paladins.

At the same time, they also reworked the classes to give them *significantly*
better puzzles and marginally better beatmaps. Previously a class might be
pressing 3-4 buttons in a deterministic rotation. Now, they might be handling
random buffs that affect their rotations, 2-4 different buttons that have high
lowest-common-denominator cooldowns that all need to be pressed when available.
(For example, consider an ability with a 7 second cooldown and another ability
with a 10). They gave the classes unique resources (sometimes multiple) to
manage - you'd be building one resource while spending another (runes/runic
power, combo points/energy).

The end result for each class is that figuring out what the next button you
should press often ended up looking like:

"Do I have a proc? How much resource1/2 do I have? Is the enemy in execute
range? Are there multiple targets? Is my short/medium/long cooldown available?
Will I get full value out of it? Which of my priority abilities are available?
Does the mob have a special vulnerability/resistance window coming up soon?"

Then, once you've solved the puzzle, the beatmap looks like "mash 4 while
solving the next puzzle".

In giving all the classes enough puzzle-complexity to keep 15-year-vets
mentally engaged, they've also given all of the classes enough *tools* that the
players start to say "hey wait a second! these classes are all the same with
different animations!"

At a certain level, they always were, right? We were always just pressing keys
on our keyboard and interacting with healthbars and the main difference was the
animations. Did it matter that the warrior's sword swung every 2.5 seconds
while the mage's frostbolt was cast every 2.5? There's still difference in
terms of toolkit, though less. I would surely take modern class design over
Vanilla. I would love to see reduced puzzle complexity in exchange for increased
beatmap complexity. Make me input multiple buttons to perform one action, like
fireball inputs in fighting games.

### No Feeling Of Community
This came, I believe, with the introduction of cross-realm battlegrounds,
group-finder, and sharding technology. The game became more single-player and
more accessible. Blizzard became able to handle launch day problems, as well
tell evolving stories in the same geographic area by putting players on
different shards. Cross-realm battlegrounds and group-finder solved queue
problems for the "I just have 30 minutes" player.

The cost was the sense of community. It might sound romantic, but in Vanilla I
actually knew tons of folks on my server and they knew me. A big part of that
was being forced to form groups and guilds with the same folks on your server
over and over, and being forced to play against the same horde premades in
Warsong Gulch every night. Solve queue problems letting the factions play
against each other (they always could use the practice after all). Offer
low-population servers one-way transfers to medium-population servers. Point
new players to *medium* population servers. Otherwise, make it *difficult* to
transfer. A server should be a home and feel like one. If you want to go
somewhere else, you should have to start over, not pay $25.

Solve group-finder problems using my above group-finder UI suggestion. Moderate
chat channels to get the spam and boost advertising out so that players
*actually* use it, and know to use it. Make chat for actual chat.

What happens to the players who truly only have 30 minutes to play and don't
have time to meet people, get to a dungeon, run it, and chat? The players that
only have time to teleport do a dungeon, speed-clear it, and then disappear back
offline? Making the game support that kind of play **is** what destroyed the
sense of commnity, so pick your poison.
