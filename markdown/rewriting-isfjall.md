## Preface

I've been game mastering since D&D in middle school circa the year 2000,
starting with 3.5e. Throughout my GM career, I've made *a lot* of bad
adventures, and run a lot of published modules. I think, especially when
learning a new system, that it's good to understand how the veterans of that
system use it to design adventures before going off and doing your own thing.

One of the things that kept me from trying out GURPS was the lack of lengthy
published adventures and brimming bestiaries. Paizo, for instance, routinely
publishes [adventure
paths](https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/ageOfAshes)
that take players from the beginning of the game to max level, and they take
most groups over a year to get through (if they ever do). Yet, you still need
random encounters and wandering monsters and improv for when things get off the
rails, and for that you need some sort of bestiary. As far as I could tell
about GURPS, it didn't have either of those things.

Then I found saw an advert for [the nordlond
bestiary](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gamingballistic/nordlond-bestiary-and-enemies-book)
which, at a higher pledge level, included *a whole slew of adventures*, in the
setting. [Gaming Ballistic](https://gamingballistic.com/) was stepping up and
providing both answers to my fundamental problem. Sold.

My group picked up [DFRPG](http://www.sjgames.com/dungeonfantasy/), I tried to
absorb the rules, and then ran *I Smell a Rat*, the included dungeon as a
tutorial to the system. In the background, I began preparing *Hall of
Judgement*, which is the adventure geared toward fresh 250-point characters.

The rest of the post will detail the prep that I did, and list out pain points
I had in parsing the text. I provide this so that others can copy my work, and
potentially know that you aren't alone in your confusion.

**Note**: I think it is of the utmost importance to point out that I **highly**
respect Douglas Cole and the whole Gaming Ballistic crew. I've asked *a ton* of
questions about the adventure and the setting and the kind folks over there
have limitless patience. None of what follows is meant to be **in any way**
insulting or a complaint.

## A Note About Details
Much about what follows will be me taking the text given and then *fleshing it
out*. I make comment that my job as a GM would have been easier, and thus the
book would have been more valuable if these details were provided. It should be
noted that this is only true of me, and folks like me.

There's a whole other camp of reasonable folks whose experience would have been
*worse* if read-aloud text was thrust upon them. Folks who already know exactly
what *their* Isfjall Inn ought to be like, what season it is, what'll happen in
town, and all about the shops and their keepers.

I know this because I've had this exact conversation with Douglas Cole before.
We've talked about how tough it is to please both camps of folks. How if you
flesh out a book to the degree that I do below, it becomes too thick; too
expensive.

I think there's a few good options:

+ Make it *extremely* clear that the whole thing is a toolbox with some sort of
  boxed blurb. Don't like the provided Inn, NPCs, backstory, or whatever? You
  don't have to use them! Use your own stuff!
+ Sell the detail separately. Isfjall can say stuff like "The adventurers can
  rest at an inn of your own divising, or 'Odin's Beard' from *Nordlond
  Taverns, Shops, and Proprietors, page 31*". Then that book can be a big ol'
  index of Nordlond flavored Taverns, Shops, Proprietors, and town encounters
  that we can use *if we want*.

I really like the second solution here. It makes it so the folks that don't
care don't have to pay for the extra pages.

## Isfjall and Finding A Quest

The book gives us a ton of info about Isfjall: it's history (former dragon
thralls ran away after the dragon empire fell and founded isfjall), it's
climate (cold), the types of folks who live there (permament residents,
snowbirds, traders, vistors), info about laws, customs, religion, trade, and
guilds. Flipping through though, there's very little on *specifics*. If the
party wants to get some ale, what's the name of the inn? The innkeeper? If they
want to buy/sell weapons (they will), acquire delving goods (they will), where
do they go and what's the name/description of the person who sells it to them?

Fresh out of absorbing the DFRPG rulebooks, GMs should have internalized a
structure that's reinforced by *I Smell A Rat*: DFE14: **Finding A Quest**. In
*I Smell A Rat*, the **Carousing** roll is at +4, and the quest you get is
*from Lee*. *HoJ* says:

> The search for the Lost Hall likely begins when rumors around town lead to
> Geirolf Tyrthegn, a cleric of the God of Law who is convinced, against all
> counterargument, that the artifact and sword recently returned from the slain
> holy warrior Gyrid portend dire consequences and events in the Frostharrow,
> and perhaps in all of Norðlond.

Woah, lots to unpack here, and a lot to rewind in order to have a coherent
campaign. Say that you're just like me, and this is the first Nordlond (first
gurps adventure at all, really) adventure you're running. What are all of these
nouns, events, and plot points? As a GM, I would really appreciate having the
book restructured so that none of this is mysterious.

Taking a step back. The point of a adventure module is to take a world and
adventure that lives in an author's head, encode it into a book, then have a GM
decode it into their brain. We want to write it in a way to make this decoding
process as painless as possible. Then, the GM, who knows all the mysteries,
secrets, and hidden things, feeds mystery and adventure to the players.

The other job of an adventure module is to provide guidance to (potentially
fledgling) GMs on how to run the adventure. How to pace it, how to make it
dramatic, advice on what to say.

The time they can do this the best is before anything has the chance to get off
the rails: Session 1. The adventure module can provide a GM with all of the
context they need for their first session. That all starts with the opening
speech, which we'll craft. 

Here's an example from Caravan to Ein Arris:

> The air is buzzing in the market of Khedris – the great market that
> stretches from the fishmongers on the shore to Caravan Square. Halmaro the
> Red – master of the powerful Merchants’ Guild, second in power in Khedris
> only to the emperor of Lantara himself – is organizing a caravan! And this is
> no ordinary caravan; it will carry goods and gifts for the wedding of
> Halmaro’s daughter Kira to Prince Eiru of Mashanda.

It goes on 5 more paragraphs! Really cool writing.

Here's the intro from [Abomination Vaults](https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/abominationVaults)

> When the fog is creeping \
> And the moon is low \
> When the town is sleeping \
> Gauntlight starts to glow! \
> \
> That’s when she arises \
> For her midnight lunch. \
> Naughty kids are prizes \
> For her teeth to crunch. \
> \
> But if you obey me, \
> And obey the rules; \
> You’re safe from Belcorra; \
> She just eats the fools!
>
> So warns a popular nursery rhyme among the parents in the town of Otari, as
> they often sing the melodious but unsettling poem to their children at night
> to encourage good behavior. As a result, everyone who grows up in Otari has a
> healthy mix of fear, respect, and curiosity for the old ruins out in Fogfen
> and the strange lighthouse that stands at the swamp’s heart. As they grow
> older, townsfolk learn what’s more often accepted as truth: that the heroic
> founders of Otari had slain the wicked sorcerer Belcorra many years ago. For
> a time, thrill-seekers explored the ruins around the lighthouse called
> Gauntlight, but today, common knowledge holds that the place has become a
> haven for pests—no longer a source of active danger or significant treasure
> after being completely picked over. Nearly 500 years has passed since
> Belcorra’s defeat after all, and in that time, she has only posed a menace to
> Otari through sinister rhymes.

So you as the GM probably ought to give *some* sort of speech to set the scene.
There's a whole bunch of guidance about the various festivals on HoJ:9-12, and
this allows us to make another important decision: *what's the date?*

The book makes no recommendation, the campaign is fresh and I don't have a
preference. There are two holidays a month, and there is fully spec'd climate
chart for each month on HoJ29. So, I asked Douglas Cole himself, and he
recommended October. It's warm enough that delvers feel comfortable going out,
but if they dally... winter is coming.

So, let's go with October 1st. *What year is it?*

This is actually difficult too. HoJ doesn't mention anything about the Nordlond
calendar, but Forest's End gives us the following timeline.

| Year  | Event                       |
| ----- | --------------------------- |
| -6812 | Creation of the Elfard      |
| -4812 | The Shattering / Ravym Born |
| -2112 | Vaesukir's Death            |
| -796  | Dwarf-King Barakthel Dies   |
| -310  | Audreyn's Wall Completed    |
| 0     | Nordlond Founded            |
| 962   | Skogurenda Founded          |
| 965   | Present Day                 | 

It makes sense to me, then, that the people of Nordlond would date their
calendar "FN" for "Founding of Nordlond", and that the year is 965 FN. Other
races use a *different* calendar based on the Shattering (when a group of the
faerie broke the leyferds (leylines), disrupting magic in general, and
especially the magic that united/empowered the dragons). The civilizations
would date their calendars "PS" for "Post-Shattering", and all of the dates
would be increased by 4812:

| Year  | Event                       |
| ----- | --------------------------- |
| -2000 | Creation of the Elfard      |
| 0     | The Shattering / Ravym Born |
| 2700  | Vaesukir's Death            |
| 4016  | Dwarf-King Barakthel Dies   |
| 4502  | Audreyn's Wall Completed    |
| 4812  | Nordlond Founded            |
| 5774  | Skogurenda Founded          |
| 5777  | Present Day                 | 

So, today's date is October 1st, 965 FN, 5777 PS (depending on calendar). A
good day for adventuring.

Okay! We have a date, and that date allows us to figure out the festival. That
festival allows us to describe the opening scene (since the scene would
drastically change depending on which festival the town was currently throwing).

What all do we need for a coherent first session? There's an article about
[creating a script](https://theangrygm.com/like-players-do/) of a session, and
using that script to structure your prep that I find *very* useful. So, here's
my script of the opening session for "Hall of Judgement".

> I'll read a really dramatic and cool opening speech that sets the scene of
> Isfjall during Remembrance Day (HOJ:11), then ask the players what they want
> to do. They'll probably want to find a place to sleep, send someone to look
> for work (DFE14), and other folks will try to score extra cash (DFE14). While
> they're doing this, I'll bombard them with town encounters to keep things
> spicy and make the town feel alive. They'll eventually get approached by
> Geirolf Tyrthegn who gives them a quest to find the hall, and then they'll
> probably want to gear up for the trip. They might try to find a sponsor.

Converting that into an itemized todo list:

- [ ] An opening speech
- [ ] A week's worth of town encounters
- [ ] A fleshed out place for them to sleep
- [ ] A fleshed out place for them to buy/sell weapons/armor equipment
- [ ] A fleshed out place for them to buy/sell delving equipment
- [ ] A fleshed out place for them to buy/sell magical items
- [ ] A scene prepared for when they *Find a Quest* and are approached by Geirolf Tyrthegn
- [ ] A fleshed out sponsor
- [ ] Scenes for the info the drudged up via *Tavern Tales and Moldy Books* (DFE15)

It would be *really* nice if this was what the pages of Isfjall related
materials was written about. I would have loved an opening speech, town encounters and
shops with merchants; that would have saved me a *ton* of prep. Fortunately for
you dear reader, I did the prep, and so you can copy. Fortunately for me, I
have heaps of tables!

### The Opening Speech

Here's what we know:

+ It's October 1st, 965 FN
+ It's Remembrance Day (viking halloween; awesome!)
+ Isfjall's population is big in the summer, small in the winter, so folks ought to be leaving
+ Most folks (and goods) travel by boat down the river
+ It's cold
+ The mountain is situated right next to Einmannafjall HOJ:3
+ the town has multiple rings HOJ:3 (sort of like paris)
+ Lake Odin is deep and has myterious stuff in it.
+ The docks are impressive

So how about:

> It is October 1st, 965 years after the foundation of Nordlond, and it's
> cold. It's *damn* cold. That's the second thing you notice as your Ana Rottur
> rowboat effortlessly glides over the waters of Lake Odin. The first thing was
> Einmannafjall. You'd heard tale of "The Lonely Mountain" before; of it's
> height; it's magesty. Seeing it in person is a different thing all together. \
> \
> As your boat crosses into the Lake proper, you feel, you really *feel* that
> it's alive. Not just that it contains life. It does. Or that it sustains it.
> It does that too. But that *the lake itself* is alive and *wants you to know
> it*. That maybe if you started sinking, that well... maybe you'd never stop. \
> \
> A boat bumps into yours; disrupting your thoughts. It seems like what you
> heard of the Isfjall folk was right; not all of them are crazy enough to
> spend the winter somewhere this *cold*. There's a lot of boats around you,
> passing you, going the *other way*. \
> \
> But you guys are made of sturdy stuff, and maybe you're a little bit crazy.
> You are delvers after all. You arrive at Isfjall's impressive docks, eager to
> stretch your legs. You find a town in the misdt of a festival! Wandering from
> the docks to the market square, you see adults and children in costume,
> dressed up in the guise of monsters and spirits. \
> \
> Your stomach groans and you remember your priorities. You'll need to find
> somewhere to eat and sleep, and you need a *job*; which for you means some
> godforsaken place to delve into, loot, and haul it all back. What do you do?

- [x] An opening speech

### A Week's Worth of Town Encounters

The HoJ makes *vague* reference to town encounters: "Not more than one step
(HOJ:8)" talks about how folks *really* like testing other folks that aren't
carrying weapons via insult/shoulder check and try to intice them into a
wrestling match. "Unlicensed Commerce (HOJ:7)" talks about how folks who
participate in unlicensed trade twice will be "cornered in a dark alley and
beated within an inch of their life". "Crime, Weregild, and Judicial Combat"
talks about how victims of a crime *sell* their right to extract vengence.

So:

+ Someone challenges a party member because they stepped too away from their
  weapon. If you win, they'll pay your room for the evening ($21). People start
  placing side-bets.
+ You come across mixologist guild thugs hopped up on strength potions beating
  the snot out of a wirey Bjornhjarta alchemist (Elmar Sandsson, bear-folk) for
  selling their own potions direct-to-consumer.
+ An old widow (Veiga Evansdottir) approaches (a random party member) at night,
  as you're about to head in for the evening. She explains that her daughter
  (Aris Thyrilsdottir) was beaten to death by her daughter's new husband
  (Gilmar Hlesson). She lacks might to seek redress, but she'll sell the blood
  debt to you for (spits on the ground) 1 silver.

3 down, 4 to go! [Charles Saeger](http://gurpshexytime.blogspot.com/)
recommends [Midkemia's
Cities](https://www.midkemia.com/HomePage/OrderForm.html) for random town
encounter tables. [Here's a preview](https://midkemia.com/HomePage/SupportFiles/CitiesBook-sampler.pdf).
We also need a way to generate NPC names. I use
[this](https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/icelandic-names.php). Also,
because I keep my notes digitally and can't search for charcters like þ or ð, I
use a pretty simple conversion that I homebrewed. I use the same for the
bestiary. `þ => th`, `ð => d`. All accented characters get their accent
dropped. Easier for my USA english-only brain. That means a name like "Þjóðann
Kaldason" is "Thjodann Kaldason", and the holiday "Alþingi" is "Althingi".

Using that, we get:

+ The PCs see a watchmen, one of which (Jack Thorleifsson) the characters
  (mistakenly) recognize as an old acquaintance.
+ You witness a theft (by Kari Helgadottir) attempt (on Kristianna
  Astmarsdottir).
+ An encounter with a local character of the city (Ragnar Palmason) who is not
  necessarily important but is at least colorful.
+ You see an assassination attempt on a Jarl's (Una Jorvadottir) life.

These are intentionally left more vague to be filled out based on the party.
For instance, if you have a wizard in the party, perhaps the Jarl (Una
Jorvadottir) is connected to the local wizard's guild and can get your party's
wizard a foot in the door.

Also important to note: these are
*[problems](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/4147/roleplaying-games/dont-prep-plots)*,
not *quests*. The players can handle (or not handle) these however they want.

constant nightmares is that he's haunted by a Matrod (bestiary:140). He'll die
within the week if left alone. Maybe the Matrod moves on to their next favorite
shopkeeper.

### The Scene with Geirolf Tyrthegn

Here, we can lean into our town encounters. If the party decided to help Jarl
Una Jorvadottir not be assassinated, Kristianna Astmarsdottir not get stolen
from, Elmar Sandsson not get beat up, etc, then *they* can introduce the party
to Geirolf and it feels like a nice callback.

Otherwise, the party member attempting *Find a Quest* hears word that Geirolf
Tyrthegn, a priest of Tyr, is funding a trip to find the lost Hall of
Judgement. He's paying upfront, but you have to swear an *oath*.

They're given directions to Geirolf's office in Tyr's Temple.

Here's where things get tricky. The text says

> The search for the Lost Hall likely begins when rumors around town lead to
> Geirolf Tyrthegn, a cleric of the God of Law who is convinced, against all
> counterargument, that the artifact and sword recently returned from the slain
> holy warrior Gyrid portend dire consequences and events in the Frostharrow,
> and perhaps in all of Norðlond. \
> \
> Geirolf is in possession of both sword and relic (which he calls a tiwstakn);
> he is also in possession of the stolen manuscripts and maps from the Isfjall
> archives. He is actively looking for another group of thegns to rediscover
> the Lost Hall. \
> \
> Isfjall and its surrounds are hard-pressed. This is always the case: the town
> is prosperous but the life is hard, and its location near the Hunted Lands
> (Veiddarlönd) as well as the Frostharrow pose a constant threat. The

> \
> Nonetheless, Geirolf is looking for a few good thegns. He is at odds with the

> finding of the relic are connected. The last meeting of the Alþingi was
> somewhat boisterous. \
> ... \
> Geirolf is convinced that the time is ripe to rediscover the Hall, and that
> the Hall, the activity of faerie in the frostharrow, the surge of demonic
> cult activity, and the growing instability of the magic of Lake Odin are
> connected. Pro tip: He’s right.

Now we need to unpack this. 
+ What artifact? 
+ What sword? 
+ How was Gyrid slain?
+ If Gyrid was slain, how did the artifact/sword make their way to Geirolf?
+ Why does this portend dire consequences for Nordlond?
+ Why does it's location near the Hunted Lands pose a threat?
+ Why is there a recent surge in the dead rising?
+ Why is the Hall of Judgement a lost legend?
+ How is the undead uprising, the demon-cult activity, and the finding of the
  relic connected, the activity of the faerie in the frostharrow, and the
  growing instability of the magic of Lake Odin connected?
+ Why are folks arguing against him?

#### What Artifact?
The text says that the artifact is called a "Tiwstakn". As written, it:
+ Lets someone cast pathfinder using Geirolf's special map to locate the hall
  (if they know the ritual)
+ Lets someone have an easier time casting magelock / praying to open the
  Sturdy Door in Logiheimli
+ Lets someone into the Vault of Law in the Hall of Judgement

As written, there would be *very* little chance Rules-As-Written of the party
*just so happening* to use the map+tiwstakn ritual correctly. You must have two
people: one person recites the oath to seek the Hall of Judgement while the
other person simultaneously casts Pathfinder specifically while both of them
hold the map.

The text provides no guidance on how the players would figure out that this
is the appropriate ritual. Instead, it suggests that "If the players can't find
the hall, there are other clues in Logiheimli, and Geirolf knows it was
important to questors (folks who used to seek the hall) in the past, so he can
send them there."

Options:

+ Tone down the requirements of the ritual. Make it so that simply having the
  tiwstakn and map nearby allows the pathfinder to work, so that the party
  might do it accidentally.
+ Make the tiwstakn and map both trigger a wizard's passive magic detection on
  sight/touch. Inform the wizard on analyze magic about these properties.
+ Geirolf has already done the ritual and just tells the party where the hall
  is, and how to repeat the ritual.

Of these options, the third is the most coherent. Geirolf *knows* that these
objects are important and probably magical. He would have brought them to a
Wizard and had them analyzed if that's possible. The party wizard being the
first person to be like "oh wow, these are both magical, let me analyze
them... all we have to do is x" is cool, but then the players (my players at
least), start asking questions like "how come no one else did this?". Dang
reasonable questions.

#### What Sword?
The text says that the sword is Gyrid's blessed blade, a rare two-handed blade
forged in Vopnferd (what/where is Vopnferd? a city famous for craftmanship
about 400 miles [south-east by river](/images/nordlond-map.png)) of pattern-welded steel.

#### How was Gyrid slain? How did the artifact/sword make their way back to Geirolf?
This is the one that got me the hardest. I didn't think to prep this before we
actually played and so my players were *incredibly* suspicious of Geirolf after
the nonsense I improvised. They wanted to magically verify his story my improv
was so garbage. I still don't think they trust him, poor guy.

The original text offers only an *extremely* vague hint on HoJ:41:

> The faerie lords and ladies—and one faerie sorceress in particular—wish to
> possess the hall to enhance their status among the Winterfae nobility. The
> sorceress can’t interact with mortals herself, for reasons having to do with
> how the tiwstakn relic and the holy sword came to Geirolf in Isfjall.
> Instead...

The Faerie Noble entry on HoJ:75 has another blurb:

> This particular faerie lady’s name is Elunad. She’s been active in the
> Norðlond for some time now, and is obsessed with finding and possessing the
> Hall of Judgment. She was recently bested in a riddle contest by a Holy
> Warrior of the Law God, which lost her possession of a tiwstakn—she’s likely
> to hold a grudge about that for a very long time. Forever, in fact.

Okay, it's coming together. Gyrid bested Elunad the faerie noble in a riddle
contest that somehow lead to the tiwstakn being protected and the sorceress
being unable to interact with mortals (maybe just tiwstakn-bearing mortals?).
Then somehow Gyrid is slain anyway, and somehow the tiwstakn and Gyrid's sword
ends up in Isfjall with Geirolf.

I was confused enough about this that I contacted the GamingBallistic folks
again. As it turns out, the original *Hall of Tyr* had a longer backstory that
fleshes this out totally. It's worth taking it wholesale, that way if you have
curious players, you don't have to improv and your world has richer history.

---

> Originally, Gyrid and her band of 8 other Tyr-devotees ventured into the

This gives us two more NPCs (Gyrid's two surviving companions) that need names.
Let's go with Steinthor Gunnolason (Knight) and Einara Nerosdottir (Wizard).
They're the ones who brought back tiwstakn and sword and delivered them to
Geirolf. The scene is potentially more powerful if one of these NPCs shows up,
or is available to be interviewed.

So now we have Elunad (our first real antagonist), who is up to no good and is
probably looking for other Tiwstakn, and Gyrid in Svartalfheim that can be
potentially saved.

This also tells us how the Faerie activity in the Frostharrow is connected to
the appearance of the tiwstakn and sword. It is incoherent that anyone *doubts*
this is the case; they can simply cast Truthsayer on either Steinthor or Einara
to verify the story. Seems pretty important.

#### Why does this portend dire consequences for Nordlond?
This is relatively buried. The text says on HoJ:50

> Somewhere between where the Sacrifice Gate intersects with the spiral
> staircase and the opening to the upper chambers, the staircase actually
> shifts from being inside the mountain...to the realm of the gods themselves.
> It is for this reason the demons and faerie both wished to possess the Hall:
> The God of Law did not come to Norðlond to treat with his people...they came
> to him. 

So, a tiwstakn falling into the wrong hands means that a potential entrance to
*Asguard* falls into the wrong hands. Presumably the faerie and demons want to
get into Asguard, and the people want to keep the faeries and the demons *out*
of Asguard, given that the people worship the Asguardians. Having them
corrupted or tricked and whatnot would be real bad news.

#### Why does it's location near the Hunted Lands pose a threat?
As it turns out, Isfjall is *right on* the [Hunted
Lands](/images/nordlond-map.png). This was a case of having to dig through some
other books, but the hunted lands are everything north of Odin River,
connecting to the end of Audreyn's Wall via "The Palisade". The idea is that
Audreyn's wall keeps everything *out*, and Nordlond safe, but that's mostly for
the northeast side. The northern side isn't protected, and thus the lands
aren't as settled, and are "hunted" by Faerie, dragonkin, and giants. Hence,
"The Hunted Lands".

#### Why is there a recent surge in the dead rising?
I think this is an oversight or something similar. Let me explain!

The only reference we have to undead in the area is Logiheimli, which is
*crawling* with the dang things, and it fits the bill by being quest-related
and nearby. Unfortunately, Logiheimli was cursed 400+ years ago, so "recent
surge" of undead doesn't make sense.

Relevant passages:

> Sitting against the first significant line of hills on the western border of
> Norðlond, at the very edge of the Vsturham range, lies the ruins of a village
> and fortress. Hundreds of years of erosion, weathering, and neglect have
> reduced the once sturdy settlement into a shadow of its former self. A shadow
> haunted by the walking dead. The area is sparsely forested, but low shrubs
> and other wild growth have covered what was once one of the principal holy
> sites in Norðlond...and is now a wasted ruin. -HoJ:31

> The fortress of Logiheimli was once an important waypoint for questors
> seeking the Hall of Judgment. The forces of demonkind dispatched a heavily
> armed and trained cult to pose as questors. In the night, while the warden
> was away, they entered the temple, desecrated it, and breathed life into an
> obelisk that caused the dead to rise each night. -HoJ:32

> The bones of a dwarven smith lay where he was killed, but he’s been dead more
> than 400 years. He will tell how the wardens of the fort retreated to the
> barrows to attempt to free the land from evil influence. Eventually they were
> forced to seal themselves inside; their bones (and spirits) are still present
> inside. -HoJ:33

So, we can assume that Logiheimli was cursed 400+ years ago. There should
*definitely* be a record of it for someone with Research to unearth, if they
choose to do so, and now that we have our swanky calendar, we can give that
record an actual date. It isn't important for *players* to have precise
timelines, but it is important for GMs. Let's say that it was cursed 437 years
ago (March 8th, 528 FN).

The curse (as written), doesn't spawn skeletons or rejuvinate skeletons. The
entry for skeleton on HoJ:91 even specifically has Unhealing (total). The
wandering skeletons that players are supposed to encounter as a wilderness
encounter (HoJ:25) are the risen questors from the barrows.

> There are 24 burial areas, and each has room for 4 bodies, though not all
> were filled. -HoJ:35

So if there were only ever 96 *max* skeletons that wander, and they've been
questing out at night for the last 437 years, how could they possibly still be
any left? If one skeleton per year was *accidentally* destroyed by annoyed
roving hobgoblins, adventuring parties, pissed citizens, traveling merchants,
etc, there would be none left in 100 years, and it's been *400*. That's just at
1 skeleton per year.

So the questors wandering every night (as written) for the last 437 years is
incoherent. How do we fix it? Three main options:

+ Logiheimli was cursed *recently*
+ The skeletons have only recently started to wander
+ No matter how the skeletons are destroyed, they wind back up in Logiheimli the next day

The third option is out; we need the surge of undead to be recent. The first
option is attractive, but doesn't make a lot of sense narratively. We'd have to
rewrite everything about the warden and the dwarven smith, since the cult would
instead be cursing an unused graveyard rather than an actively occupied
pilgrimage waypoint.

That leaves the second option. Logiheimli has always been cursed, and
everything the dwarven smith and warden say stands. However! Recently the
questors have begun to wander rather meandering around Logiheimli.

Options to make this happen:
+ The curse originally made them wander, but was supressed. The supression has recently faded.
+ The curse just animated them, and was recently *altered*.

Of these two options, I prefer the second. The first would be easy to tie in:
we know that the Tyr worked with Helya to preserve the Warden and his Huskarls
until Logiheimli was cleansed. We could also say that Tyr supressed the
wandering effect, but that the blessing has faded with time.

Yet, the second allows us to tie in another antagonist. A demon-cult heard
about the good work that the original cult did cursing the place and wondered
if they couldn't spruce it up.

This introduction of a new demon cult allows us to "make it all connected" later!

#### Why is the Hall of Judgement a lost legend?
The way I see it, things are only lost legends if there was *originally*
knowledge of them (check), and then all of the folks who had that knowledge
died and the knowledge wasn't well transmitted or recorded. So instead, you get
*legends*.

We know that folks used to go to the Hall of Judgement to seek an audience with
Tyr or to read the book in the Vault of Law. Knowledge of *how* to get to the
hall; it's *location* wasn't Hidden Lore, and then something changed. As the
warden says:

> The Hall is not just lost; it is closed to farsight. Something is wrong at
> the Hall that might threaten the Gods themselves. The cultists that ruined
> the village were part of some grander plan; the demons have been scheming for
> centuries. -HoJ:37

That's the only info we get on the demon-plan thing. But! We do know why the
hall is closed to farsight: there's a heckin Krabbari in there and Tyr doesn't
want to let it into Asguard! When it breached the inner hall and started to go
up the stairs, he sealed it off and closed everything down.

Putting this together, we can write that the reason the Hall is lost is because
of the Krabbari. That means the Krabbari has been in there for long enough that
the Hall itself became a legend. Playing a little bit of connect-the-dots,
let's say that the cult that originally cursed Logiheimli is the cult that
*summoned* the Krabbari. The Krabbari went north to the Hall (and got stuck)
and the cultists went south to curse Logiheimli. Then, the surviving cultists
went about their lives, eagerly awaiting contact/reward from their Krabbari
master. It never came. Generations went by and eventually the cult died out.

#### How is everything connected?
Timeline time.

On March 6th, 528 FN a cult named Skuggaborinn (shadowsworn)
performed a horrible ritual to summon a Krabbari from Muspelheim to Midgard.

On March 8th, 528 FN, Skuggaborinn cursed Logiheimli. The Krabbari breaches the
Hall of Judgement but gets trapped. The Hall is closed off from normal
farsight. It slowly fades into legend over hundreds of years.

On August 1st, 965 FN, a cult named Hringur Likklaedsins (the ring of the
shroud) dedicated to a fearsome Istyrann are informed that their master's ally
(the Krabbari) needs to be broken out of his jail. They're to bolster the curse
on Logiheimli as a distraction (it worked last time), and track down a Tiwstakn
in an enchanted lake.

On September 14th, 965 FN, Hringur Likklaedsins bolsters the curse at
Logiheimli. They begin to set off for the enchanted lake. They're intercepted
by Elunad.

On September 15th, 965 FN, Elunad joins Gyrid's party.

On September 20th, 965 FN, Elunad betrays Gyrid's party at the enchanted lake,
but loses the tiwstakn. Steinthor and Einara journey back to Isfjall.

On September 24th, 965 FN, Steinthor and Einara make it back to Isfjall and
deliver the tiwstakn and Gyrid's sword to Geirolf. Geirolf finds the map.

On October 1st, 965 FN, the PCs arrive in Isfjall.

---

Now we have a coherent timeline. There's a surge of undead because Hringur
Likklaedsins have been fiddlin' with the curse. There's an uptick in fae
activity because Elunad noticed. That leads to the tiwstakn which eventually
got back to Geirolf. We're given *absolutely no info* on what's going on with
Lake Odin, but we can save that for another quest. Easy enough to blame it on
Elunad/faerie or Hringur Likklaedsins. Geirolf would have no idea *how* it's
all connected but he's not wrong.

The Hall of Judgement is lost and closed to farsight, but that's nothing new.
What is new is that both Hringur Likklaedsins and Elunad are looking for
another tiwstakn to get in.

#### Back to the scene with Geirolf
Now that we have our history established, we need to figure out what Geirolf
knows. He would know what Steinthor and Einara have told him; that Elunad seeks
the hall. He wouldn't know any of the other information, but I think it tracks
for him to be receiving *Omens* from Tyr. He could have a sense that the
demon-cult activity and the surge of undead are related, but not have any
concrete evidence to back that up. If pressed, he could perform a divination
ritual for the players.

Before we actually write the scene, we need a description of Geirolf Tyrthegn
himself. The book doesn't provide one - we can guess at their gender (probably
male), we're given their profession (cleric of Tyr), and we have a list of
their recent and upcoming actions:

+ Received the tiwstakn and sword from Steinthor and Einara
+ Investigated the tiwstakn and found the map
+ Discovered and performed the ritual to find the lost Hall
+ Quests the party to seek the Hall, giving them 4 ponies and supplies upfront
  as a reward for swearing an *Oath*.

So let's roll up (thanks [d30 Sandbox
Companion](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/124392/d30-Sandbox-Companion))
a profile for Geirolf Tyrthegn.

```
Name: Geirolf Tyrthegn
Body: thickset
Skin: ruddy
Face: nose, hook
Eye Color: periwinkle
Hair: bushy, over ears, dark auburn
Facial Hair: poor (stubby/long) goatee
Motivation: wanderer
Personal Inspiration: event witnessed - childhood
Personality: prim/proper
Quirky Behavior: packrat
Bad Habit: prying; mild
Burden: sense of alienation; occasional
Parent(s): military officer
Additional Family Information: was left on parents’ doorstep and raised as their own
Personal Life: is being stalked
Eccentricities: crossdresser
Talents: tobacco connoisseur
```

As a mild reminder - we don't have to take *all* of a randomly rolled NPC's
statblock wholesale; we can pick-and-choose, substituting whatever we'd think
would be more appropriate. We also don't have to work every element into every
scene. It's perfectly fine for Geirolf to *secretly* be a crossdresser and for
the PCs to potentially never find out. Or, at the very least, for the clues to
to be very non-obvious.

With the pieces in place, we can write the scene:

> You are lead into the cluttered office of a thickset, ruddy-skinned,
> middle-aged man. Their eyes are periwinkle, and their hair is a messy bush of
> dark auburn that envelops over their ears. They've chosen to sculp a stubby

> The man waits until everyone is settled in, and the guide has departed before

At this point, the party will probably have *a lot* of questions:

+ What is Tyr? (the god of law)
+ What are Storalfs? (hobgoblins)
+ Why is the Hall of Judgement important? (seek an audience with tyr, read the book in the vault of law)
+ How does Geirolf sense that it's all connected? (omen reading)

Geirolf also has two main questions for the party:

+ What are your qualifications?
+ Will you swear an oath to seek the hall?

Asking the first question allows the characters to talk about their adventuring
backstory (which you should tell them they should have, or be ready to improv).
DFRPG starting adventurers are *hecking strong*, absurdly stronger than
townsfolk. In D&D terms, they'd already be level 7 or so, I'd hazard. They
means they'd already have *a lot* of adventuring under ththeir belt, and should
be ready to talk about the cool stuff they've done before now. Try to also get
them to play up the teamwork aspect - what niche do they fill in the team dynamic?

Asking the second question is mechanically important. The tiwstakn only works
if you swear to seek the hall. We can tie this in with gurps disadvantages and
give everyone Vow (Seek the Hall of Judgement) [-10]. See Broken Promises (DFA58)
for if they accept and then don't want to/cant do it anymore.

With everyone satisfied and the heroes sworn to seek the Hall, Geirolf gives
them payment in advance: 

+ 4x: Pack Pony - 17 ST. <58 lbs: 7 move. <116 lbs: 5 move. <173 lbs: 4 move.
  <347 lbs: 2 move. <578 lbs: 1 move.
+ The tiwstakn and the map.
+ Knowledge of how to perform the pathfinder ritual.
+ 5x uncharged universal scrolls of pathfinder if no one can cast it.
+ 28 Elven Rations
+ $260 spending cash (13 silver)

The pack pony's stats are weird - it says they have a carry capacity of 175 lbs
on HoJ:14 which is "medium encumbrance", and that's 2xBL. None of this agrees
with how encumbrance or speed is calculated per DFA11.

Normally, medium encumbrance is up to 3x BL, and puts you at 0.6x move. At a
move of 7, that would be 4. Working backwards, that puts our pony at 17 total
lifting ST. Oddly, the stat-block for pack ponies on HoJ:70 gives 18 ST, 21
lifting ST, 7 Move, but still that same base 175 carry capacity. At 21 ST,
*light* encumbrance is 176 lbs (so I can see where 175 came from), but now the
move speed is 5. So, we either have 17 effective ST ponies or 21 effective ST
ponies. Let's go with 17; it's in line with the work from the Nordlond
Bestiary.

The cash is a substitue for the vatnvikur from the original text. Dungeon
Fantasy 16: Wilderness Adventures says on page 43 about water:

> Since it isn’t fun to keep track of every drop of water the party has, assume
> that each meal carried or found comes with sufficient water to meet survival
> needs. Thus, stopping to for- age finds extra water in proportion to meals;
> e.g., if the group forages 40 meals, or about 13 man-days of food, they also
> stockpile 13 man-days of water.

I totally agree. We're travelling through places with ample freshwater, and
ample snow to be melted; we don't need to lug (extremely heavy) water from town
to dungeon like this is a desert. Feel free to tell your wizards and clerics
they don't need *Create Water* if they took it. Just not worth worrying about imo.

Geirolf does **not** hand over the sword. (More about this later).

### A Sponsor
Okay! Now that the party knows that they'll be doing - trekking far to the
northwest to find the lost Hall of Judgement, they might want extra gear for
the journey. That means *Finding a Sponsor* (DFE14).

Let's reuse Ram Dagthorsson here (from Ram's Armory & Emporium) and tie in
Logiheimli and *The Law Giver*. This further allows us to tie in a Rumor (more below).

Here's the idea: Ram has caught wind that there's a storied weapon in the ruin
of Logiheimli and he wants it for his collection. He's willing to front the
party *5 gold*, but they need to either bring him back 15 gold or that weapon.

This gives us a great way to give the party a *temporary* buff to deal with the
Krabbari, introduce a cool character, and then cycle out the weapon.

Meanwhile, Ram is dealing with his own problems. He's being haunted by the
Matrod, and will survive *just* long enough for the PCs to visit him,
but he'll be on death's doorstep. Helping (or not) Ram can be another quest!

- [x] A fleshed out sponsor

### Tavern Tales and Moldy Books
HoJ:16-17 provides a list of rumors, which is *excellent* for our purposes. We can
give our party ~4 of them.

+ All Norðlonders are well advised to carry iron and steel weapons at all
  times; wood or bronze is of little to no use against faerie.
+ Some demons—the powerful ones—and certain undead can only be injured or killed by magical weapons.
+ Over 50 members of a demon cult were recently discovered performing a ritual
  designed to weaken the boundaries between the Nine Realms.
+ Travelers are warned to steer clear of stone circles and dark clefts in old
  trees, lest they fall into a norðalf warren

These are chosen specifically to mildly reinforce Geirolf's story, but also
provide useful context and foreshadow what's to come. *Now*, the party should
be thinking about Gyrid's sword. *Now* if they think to go back and ask Geirolf
for the sword, explaining that some demons can only be injured or killed by
magical weapons, he'll capitulate. This rewards the investigation and makes
the players feel involved.

The players should be able to learn this information from NPCs they've met
before: the inkeepers, shopkeepers, and town encounters we developed.

Then we need *Research*.

+ Dream journals of clerics of Tyr over the last several hundred years describe
  nightmares of a shape-shifting demon with huge pincers, locked in a divine
  prison, raging against its confines.
+ Investigations into Logiheimli reveal that the fortress was originally a
  waypoint on the pilgrimage to the Hall of Judgement, but was cursed on March
  8th, 528 FN, by a cult named Skuggaborinn, reanimating all the dead interred
  there. It's been abandoned since. Nothing about it being cleansed, nothing
  about the dead *roaming*.
+ Investigations into the Hall itself reveal that Tyr used to test pilgrims to
  make sure they were worthy of an audience. There are vague references to "The
  Climb", "The Strong Gate", and "The Sacrifice Gate" but little else.

Fortunately for us, Research just happens at the library, so no need for a NPC
or a scene. We can just narrarate a day of hard work skimming through ancient
texts in a dusty library, read the above, and then ask the player how he relays
that to the group!

## Wrapping Up
That was *a lot*. My main takeaway from this is that the book structure matters
*a lot*. My first read-through of Hall of Judgement was very confusing; I
remember reading all of the Isfjall sections and thinking "Wow, what a cool
town, this is awesome!", and then the book skipped directly to "The Lost Hall
of Judgement" and wrote out the skeleton of a scene and motivation. 

My stomache sunk thinking "where are the things *players* care about?" What
does this guy look like? Where are the NPCs they'll interact with? What are
these problems and places that they're referencing - did I miss something? How
do I actually start the game? There's this great post that [Charles
Saeger](http://gurpshexytime.blogspot.com/) links to called [twenty quick
questions for your campaign
setting](http://jrients.blogspot.com/2011/04/twenty-quick-questions-for-your.html)
and I think rewriting Isfjall so that *these* answers are bolded, front and
center would have been awesome.

Next, I would have *really* appreciated a GM-side timeline of the events
relevant to the quest. I would have loved to know what year it is. As the GM, I
need to know the full, detailed context of *what happened* before I can
understand the adventure the players are about to go on, or how to run the NPCs
or world. Extracting that from NPC dialog, bestiary entries, and scattered
across a bunch of chapters should be the *player's job*, not the GMs.

But! This is the best TTRPG community I've ever had the pleasure to be a part
of. The ideas are *top notch*, and being able to actually talk to the authors
and other GMs is an experience like no other.

Hopefully this helps. Hopefully it helps both GMs looking to run Hall of
Judgement, as well as folks looking to write their own modules trying to
understand how it looks from the side of someone trying to absorb your writing.

This was just the opening sessions in Isfjall. Follow-up posts will cover
rewriting Logiheimli and [travel](/posts/rewriting-travel).
