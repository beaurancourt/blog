In their [2008 gamasutra
article](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/111594/Opinion_On_Progression_In_Games.php),
Andrew Doull writes a foundational article about progression in RPGs and how
the concept is abused at large in game design. Doull splits up the concept of
progression into two types, Character Progression and Player progression
defined as follows:

> Player progression is the increasing aptitude of the player in mastering the
> game: whether through learning and understanding the technical rules of the
> game (surface play) or the implications of those rules (deep play).

> Character progression is the unlocking of additional rules of play, or
> altering the existing rules, by choices or actions within the game. The most
> common unlock is the ability: an additional in-game interaction that the
> playerâ€™s avatar can choose to do. But scaling upwards existing abilities is
> just as common in the RPG space.

I **love** these definitions! I think they're extremely useful to keep in mind
while thinking about [intrinsic fun](/posts/intrinsic-fun) and game design. On
a personal level, I care *almost nothing* about my character progression,
and am also completely unimpressed by other people's character progression.
Being forced to spend time progressing my character so that I'm *allowed* to fight
another player or NPC upsets me. Being forced to complete small, timegated
trivial tasks periodically (like weekly torghast, for example) is *extremely
tilting*.

Significantly better design is allowing elite players to complete challenges
early while allowing lesser skilled players to compensate with character power.
A perfect example of this is in dark souls 1, where it's [technically
possible](https://youtu.be/K2NnqEb0Xr0?t=42) for a new player to defeat the
first enemy in the game with the broken hilt of a sword, and they may choose to
do so. If that's not their jam, they can simply
[leave](https://youtu.be/tNnmuu-9Q8M) and come back later after their
*character* has progressed. Beautiful!

Remarkably, this is how the race to world first in every wow expansion works.
When guilds like Echo and Complexity-Limit try to fight the bosses for the
first time, they do it when their characters have the *least* amount of character
progression. Each week that goes by, their characters progress by acquiring
more gear, and the statically difficult boss fights *require less player
progression*. By the time top-5000 guilds are attempting the content instead
top 10 guilds, they have characters that are *significantly stronger* compared
to their top-10 counterparts, and this is *wonderful*.

FFXIV *removes* character progression for their elite content, and
it's an absolute joy. FFXIV does not allow meaningful character customization,
and their elite content will apply an item-level template to your character, to
either bring you up-to-snuff, or lower you down to exactly the character-power
level they designed the content to be completed at. This allows them to
fine-tune the difficulty of the encounter to make it exactly as difficult as
intended, and allows them to fine-tune class balance so that each class' playstyle
is exactly what they intended. They trade *freedom* for *elegance*.

Meanwhile, ARPGs like Diablo 3 and Path of Exile feel like they're nearly
*entirely* about character progression. The [intrinsic fun](/posts/intrinsic-fun)
for those games seems like it's about testing/researching builds and then
experiencing how good your *character* is at carnage. Your player skill at
build research translates to your character being more powerful. Players then
play the game, choosing the difficulty / clear speed that affords them the most
currency/expected loot per hour while minimizing risk of death. When their
characters grow in strength, they adjust the difficulty upwards to compensate so
that they never have to tax their own player skill. There are a few player-skill
checks like difficult bosses that require nimble mouse movement and game-knowledge
to not get wrecked by the boss's aoe attacks, but the *vast* majority of your
gametime is spent in comfortably farming maps to increase your character power
so you can comfortably farm more maps.

I think games that emphasize character progression over player progression are
on some level predatory. Character power progression is a drip-fed dopamine
rush since you feel like *you* leveled up when your *character* levels up,
because *you* are represented by *your character*. Games, like RPGs that lock
character progression behind RNG systems (like random loot) are thinly
disguised [skinner
boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning_chamber) and I really
wish the reliance on these systems could be dimished.
